## Overview

Extreme weather events affect outdoor activities, agriculture, logistics, and public safety. Traditional short-term forecasts (1‚Äì3 days) often fail to provide actionable long-term insights. Our project leverages **NASA datasets (Giovanni portal ‚Äì IMERG & MERRA-2)** and **probabilistic modeling** to give users an interactive dashboard where they can:

* Select a **location and time** (by typing, pinning on the map, or drawing a boundary).
* Explore **historical NASA data** combined with **forecast models** to estimate probabilities of weather conditions.
* Visualize **clear, interactive statistics** (time series, probability distributions, heatmaps).
* Receive **text-based explanations** that are simple and actionable (e.g., *‚ÄúHigh risk of heavy rain ‚Äì consider backup plans‚Äù*).
* **Export results** in CSV or JSON with metadata (units + source).

### Example Use Case

*‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a 65% chance that temperatures will exceed 35¬∞C in this location in early August.‚Äù*

This helps event planners, farmers, and communities prepare for extreme weather well in advance.

## 1. Objective

Build a predictive model for estimating weather conditions, particularly rainfall, using NASA datasets (IMERG and MERRA-2).

---

## 2. Data

* **Source:** NASA Giovanni portal (IMERG for precipitation, MERRA-2 for atmosphere & air quality).
* **Variables considered:**

  * Precipitation (rainfall intensity)
  * Temperature (incl. Extreme Heat Index)
  * Windspeed
  * Humidity
 

We focus on these **key variables** since they directly impact outdoor planning, without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity.

---

## 3. Data Processing & Modeling

1. **Data Collection**

   * Downloaded from NASA Giovanni portal.
   * Pre-processed to align spatial/temporal granularity.
2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extracted climate indicators for each location & time.
   * Standardized units & added metadata.
3. **Modeling Approach**

   * Probabilistic weather prediction using historical patterns.
   * Time-series analysis for trends.
   * Probability distributions to estimate likelihood of extreme conditions.
   * Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, ARIMA, LSTM for sequential patterns).

---
## 4. Mobile Application Overview 

We developed a **cross-platform mobile application** using **Flutter** to provide users with on-the-go access to weather insights.  
The app allows users to:  
- Select a location and time directly from their mobile device.  
- View personalized forecasts and interactive charts.  
- Receive simplified text-based recommendations (e.g., *"High chance of heavy rain ‚Äì consider carrying an umbrella"*).  

This ensures accessibility and usability beyond the web dashboard, making forecasts available anytime, anywhere.
